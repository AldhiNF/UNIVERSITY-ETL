# UNIVERSITY-ETL

An end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project that fetches data from a public university domain API, processes and enriches it, stores it in Google BigQuery, and visualizes key insights using Looker Studio.

```

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AldhiNF/UNIVERSITY-ETL.git
cd UNIVERSITY-ETL
```

2. **Create virtual environment and install dependencies**
```bash
conda create -n university-etl python=3.10 -y
conda activate university-etl
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Prepare Google Cloud Credentials**
- Create a service account in Google Cloud.
- Download the `gcp_key.json` file and place it in `config/` directory.

4. **Run ETL Pipeline Manually**
```bash
python etl-deployment.py
```
Or trigger via **Prefect Cloud** if deployed.
